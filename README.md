# Movie-Recommendation-System_ELEVATELAB_INTERN
This repository hosts a Movie Recommendation System built with Python, leveraging Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Streamlit. It intelligently suggests movies by combining collaborative filtering (based on user ratings) and content-based filtering (using movie genres). The project features an intuitive web interface developed with Streamlit, allowing users to select a movie they like and even adjust the influence of genre similarity on recommendations. Dive in to explore how machine learning can personalize your movie-watching experience!
